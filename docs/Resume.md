## Projects
**Mar 2021**  
**A Comparative Study of LGBM-SVR Hybrid Machine Learning Model for Rainfall Prediction**
- Authored for undergraduate final year project in a team of two in guidance from our professor
- Was published in IEEE Xplore with DOI [10.1109/ICCCNT51525.2021.9579628](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCNT51525.2021.9579628) after presenting at a
conference
- Predicted the amount of rainfall that might pour a particular day depending on the other weather metrics. Since we were predicting the amount of rainfall, this was a regression problem

**Dec 2019**  
**Predict Late Flight Arrivals**
- Submitted for Unisys Cloud 2020 Competition as a team of three
- Classified if a particular flight was going to arrive late using existing flights, airports and weather data. Weather data was external data used for enhancing the accuracy of the model.
